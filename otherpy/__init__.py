"""
Basic:
- preprocess data
- build sequential models
- build/train models for binary classification ,
multi-class categorization
- loss and accuracy
- use pretrained models
- extract features
- batch loading
- use callbacks
- use datasets

Image classification:
- define convolutional with Conv2D and Pooling layers
- use image augmentation to prevent overfitting
- use ImageDataGenerator

NLP:
- build models to identify category of text using binary categorization or
multi-class categorization
- use word embeddings
- use LSTM to classify for binary or multi-class categorization
- add RNN and GRU layers
- use RNNs , LSTMs, GRUs, CNNs for text
- train LSTM on existing text to generate text

Time, sequences and predictions:
 - train, tune and use time series, sequence and prediction models
 - prepare data for time series
 - understand MAE and accuracy
 - use RNN and CNN for time series, sequence and forecasting models
 - use TF for forecasting
 - identify and compensate for sequence bias
 - adjust LearningRate in time series, sequence and prediction models
